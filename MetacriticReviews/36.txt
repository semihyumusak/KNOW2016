This is nowhere near a bad album. [#12, p.95]
	If electroclash left you cold...  then this is, idealistically, how it should have sounded.
	A fantastic collection of beats and styles, but chilling out and adding a little more variety could have produced a classic. [#7]
	A guilty pleasure.
	The Prodigy was never about subtlety, but Howlett is stepping more carefully this time. [Oct 2004, p.104]
	After such an extended hiatus, one expects more from a Prodigy album than "Firestarter" knockoffs like "Get Up Get Off." [17 Sep 2004, p.76]
	For all its sonic sizzle, Prodigy's fourth album feels frustrated. [Oct 2004, p.113]
	Strong and competent, but devoid of the kind of charge needed to make a new mark.
	This ainÂ’t no classic.
	Trouble is, although forced to move on, Howlett had nowhere particular to go, and so much of this album sees him squatting on the floors of other acts. [14 Aug 2004, p.47]
	Lacks the hooks and memorable vocals... that formerly made this band so effective at marrying the pop and the underground. [Sep 2004, p.92]
	A disc that sounds like it's... 1998.
	It's like a series of beats in search of a firestarter. [3 Oct 2004]
	Barely enough for five years of waiting and hardly up to the old standard.
	Mainly, though, this is a terribly weary album, tedious when it strives to be seditionary, trading on utterly devalued notions of attitude and aggression.
	Just underwhelming.
	After all these years, is that it? [Sep 2004, p.110]
	Three out of 12 [songs] work... The rest sounds hurried or half-baked.
	The album equivalent of a Civil War reenactment. [30 Sep 2004, p.190]
	Outgunned is a mess of unfocused energy and uncomfortably irrelevant sonics, an odd mix of cartoonish immediacy and tired youth-cult ideas that would be the perfect soundtrack to Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie: The Movie.
	Every track emerges as ugly and joyless as the one before. [Oct 2004, p.127]
	One shudders to think how wack the rejects are. [Nov 2004, p.156]
	Were Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned released in 1999 when everyone else was releasing their mediocre post-big beat follow-up album, though it would still be unlistenable, it would also be excusable.
